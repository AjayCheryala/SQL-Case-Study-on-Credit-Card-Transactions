# SQL-Case-Study-on-Credit-Card-Transactions

The SQL case study on credit card transactions focuses on analyzing and extracting insights from a dataset containing credit card transaction records. The dataset used in this case study consists of credit card transactions recorded over a specific period (Oct, 2013 - May, 2015). Each transaction record typically includes information such as City, Date, Card Type, Exp Type, Gender and Amount.

The case study covers several key aspects of credit card transaction analysis, throughout the case study, SQL queries will be designed and executed to address specific analytical objectives. 

### These queries will leverage various SQL functions, such as
• Aggregate functions - SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX

• Cast

• Round

• Window functions – SUM(), RANK (), DENSE_RANK (), ROW_NUMBER ()

• Sub queries

• Date functions

• Multi-Tables Joins

• Concatenate

• CASE WHEN statement

• Where clause

• Common Table Expression (CTE)


## SQL Challenge Questions

1. write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends

2. write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

3. write a query to print the transaction details (all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends (We should have 4 
   rows in the o/p one for each card type)

4. write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type

5. write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type, lowest_expense_type (example format: Delhi, bills, Fuel)

6. write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type

7. which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014

8. during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transactions ratio

9. which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after first transaction in that city
